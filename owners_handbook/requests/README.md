## Platform updates

## Adding a peer

## Translated content

Requests for Translated content can either be support from the unfrozen locale teams or a team looking to unfreeze a locale.

### Support

The current locale teams are fairly self sufficient and requests from them are low traffic. Most can be dealt with by the guidelines set above as they will be platform updates or new features, or requests for peers to be added removed.

Anything else can be discussed directly with the contributor. If input is needed from a wider set of translated content contributors, open a discussion or issue on the [Translated content repository](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content) following the [issue guidelines]()

### Unfreezing a locale

The guidelines for a community member to request a [locale to be unfrozen are here](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content/blob/main/PEERS_GUIDELINES.md#activating-a-locale). They will get in touch with one of the core peers or owners through [appropriate channels](). If the request is agreed upon the locale can be unfrozen and added to mdn/translated-content.

Task list for unfreezing a locale

- Raise a platform request to unfreeze locale
- Communicate with requester time scale
- Create a team under the Translated Content team, with contributors, update the [CODEOWNERS file](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) and set team to be sent pr reviews for their locale prs
- Create a label on mdn/translated-content and mdn/content for that locale
- Update github action to move any issues on mdn/content with that label to mdn/translated-content
- Introduce requester to other locale teams - they will help with 'How tos' and other queries
